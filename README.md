README
================

## Purpose

This Repository houses all the work necessary to complete the final
project for the DAT 410 course at Southern New Hampshire University.
Specifically, it is done for the ‘Medical’ portion as there are 3
choices to pick from *(similar to pokemon)*.

This readme will also keep track of the different steps completed and
when the full project is done.
